This package is designed to create path-independent binary
release of the GNU toolchain, QEMU simulator and other related
tools for a variety of embedded targets, starting with ARM.

At the end of the day this should produce a tar ball containing
a simple to extract set of tools.



/install

This directory contains the files that are tarred up and ready for
release. Only the end binaries we wish to release get installed here,
and not intermediate tools that we need along the way.

/devtree

This is where we install intermediate libraries such as gmp, mpfr, mpc,
gettext, glib, ffi, etc. These libraries we don't need to ship as
part of the binaries so we separate them. Additionally, the libraries
and tools in here are not easily path independent, so they are actually
compiled to this hard coded location.
